# SibJob: A Motivational Chore-Tracking System for Siblings

The plans for this code are to implement a web site that will help motivate kids to perform chores
around the house on a daily and weekly schedule. I have tried this system with my own children, and
it seems to work (given that any kids are not going to want to do chores, and no system is going to
totally change that).

I'm going to write it first to work for my family, and then host a site where other families can join
and use it.  I'm not really expecting to get rich from this; I may put some ads on the site or something
if it seems to be popular, but that's it. Therefore, I don't really have an issue with making the
repository public.

The site will be at sibjob.bajink.com while I'm getting it going, and will eventually move to sibjob.com.
